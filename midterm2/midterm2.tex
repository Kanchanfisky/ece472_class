\begin{enumerate}

\item (10 points) 9.23
	When a CPU writes to the cache, both the item in the cache and the corresponding
	item in the memory must be updated. If data is not in the cache, it must be
	fetched from memory and loaded in the cache. If $t_{1}$ is the time taken to
	reload the cache on a miss, show that the effective average access time of the
	memory system is given by \\
	$t_{ave} = ht_{c} + (1-h)t_{m} + (1-h)t_{1}$

\item[\textbullet] Assuming the cache does not have to be reloaded, the average
	access time is equal to \\
	$t_{ave} = ht_{c} + (1-h)t_{m}$ \\
	In this case, the cache does take time to reload. For a single access, the time
	taken to reload the cache must be added to the no-miss access time. Since we are
	concerned about the average time, the cache reload time multiplied by the cache
	miss ratio must be added to the prior equation. This gives us \\
	$t_{ave} = ht_{c} + (1-h)t_{m} + (1-h)t_{1}$ \\
	which is the hit ratio multiplied by the cache access time plus the miss ratio
	multiplied the memory access time plus the miss ratio multiplied by cache reload
	time.
